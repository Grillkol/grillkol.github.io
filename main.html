				<h1>Bio</h1>
				<p>Hello! I'm a passionate roblox scripter and game developer with more than 3 years of scripting experience. I can create pretty much anything.
				My main project is my survival and exploration game Bonk. The project is not currently finished. I have experience in many different aspects such as inventory systems, terrain generation and tools.
				I'm looking forward for new work and challenges. You are always welcome to message me for questions about hiring, my capabilities and my pricing.</p>
